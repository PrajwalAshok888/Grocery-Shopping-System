# Grocery-Shopping-System
Project Description:
- This Flask-based project is a web application for an online grocery store.
- Users can log in using their username and password, and their information is stored in a MySQL database.
- The application has different sections for vegetables, fruits, and grocery products, each displaying relevant items with their prices.
- Users can view and add products to their cart, specifying the quantity of each item they want to purchase.
- The application also allows users to view their cart items and remove items from the cart if desired.
- Upon checkout, the user can place an order, and the order details, including the customer name, total cost, and date, are stored in the database.
- There is an admin login as well, accessible through the username 'Admin,' where the admin can view all products and manage them by adding or deleting products from the inventory.
- The project integrates MySQL to store product information, user details, cart items, and orders.
- It uses various routes and templates to render different pages, such as login, home, product views, cart, and error pages.
- The application is designed with some error handling in place to handle exceptions during database operations.
- The project includes functions to interact with the MySQL database and handle user requests.

Note: This project provides a basic implementation of an online grocery store and is intended for educational purposes. In real-world scenarios, security measures, data validation, and additional functionalities would be essential to consider.
